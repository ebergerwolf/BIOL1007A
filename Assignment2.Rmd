Given the following equation, what are the resulting values for given coordinates?

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$$

Quadrant 1 | Coordinate 1 | Quadrant 2 | Coordinate 2 | Euclidean Distance 
---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ------------ | -------------------
1          |  (1,4)       | 1          | (2,3)        | `r sqrt((2-1)^2 + (3-4)^2)`
2          |  (-3,2)      | 1          | (3,5)        | `r sqrt((3-(-3))^2 + (5-2)^2)`
4          |  (6,-1)      | 3          | (-4,-4)      | `r sqrt(((-4)-6)^2 + ((-4)-(-1))^2)`

#### A haiku for you

I am learning R.

You can *italicize* words,

And you can **bold** them.

#### My favorite books:
- The Secret History
- Namesake
- The Phantom Tollbooth
- The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy

#### Top 3 kitchen utensils
1. Pastry cutter
    - It's such a fun shape! Great for making biscuits
2. Wooden spoon
    - Super universal, great staple
3. Cutting board
    - Pain to clean, but so worth saving your countertops

### And this one's in-between!

It is 25 ^o^F outside, and so the H~2~O is frozen.

Looks different!
