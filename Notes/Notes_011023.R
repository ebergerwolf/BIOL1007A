### Notes 1/10/23 ###

# 
# git and GitHub
# - Method of version control, which allows you to keep (& restore) past versions of files
# - Also allow programmers to collaborate
# - git: Keeps track of all the files; local version control
# - GitHub: Free remote website for public data/project storage
# 
# Best formats for version control:
# - Plain text (.txt)
# - .R scripts
# - Markdown (.md/.Rmd)
# - html
# 
# Not great formats for version control (esp. in GitHub):
# - PDFs
# - Videos/pictures
# - Word docs
# 
# Markdown: text formatting language used in multiple languages
# - Type of markup language which allows you to format plain text
# - R has its own version (RMarkdown)
# 
# GitHub repository:
# - We can 'clone' (download a copy) the repo onto our local computer
# - This clone can be edited locally, without changing the global version on the web
# - Working on a repository = making changes to files, such as:
#   - Adding a new file
#   - Altering existing files
#   - Deleting existing files
# - Commit (noun): Snapshot of the current file system/local repository
#   - You can return to previous commits and bring old files/changes back
#   - Use messages to yourself to know which version you're committing
# - Commit (verb): Saving and recording your changes locally
# - Branches: Cloning a certain commit
#   - Lets you try different things to eventually (maybe) merge the offshoot branch with the main branch
# - Push: Transferring changes from local repo to GitHub repo
# - Pull: Brings down GitHub repo to your local repo to sync them (helps with remote work and collaboration)
# 
# R Project:
# - Organization system to divde your work into multiple contexts
# - Each project has its own working directory
# - Great workspace
# - Can be linked to GitHub to access history and source documents
