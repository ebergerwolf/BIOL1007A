# A Guide to GitHub Webpages

### Section 1: Installing git

Mac users: 

1. Update your software to the latest version of OSX
2. Make sure Xcode is installed. You can install the latest version of Xcode [here](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/). If you can, install "Command Line Tools for Xcode 14.2 Release Candidate"
    - ![](/Users/ev/Desktop/Screen Shot 2023-01-16 at 1.09.50 PM.png){width=30%}
    - If this doesn't work, you can download the Xcode application off of the Apple Store. Make sure you block off some time for this, since Xcode takes a while to download.
3. Install homebrew by copying and pasting the following command into Terminal: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
    - To find the Terminal application, use command-space to open the search bar and searching "Terminal".
4. Once homebrew is installed, copy and paste the following command into Terminal:
  `$ brew install git`
    - If this isn't working, check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOjSNB7F2m4).

Windows users:

1. If you haven't already, install [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).
2. Copy and paste the following command into Powershell or the command prompt:
  `winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget`
  
**You can check whether git installation worked by opening RStudio and creating a new project. There should be an option to choose "Create a git repository"**

8. Select the repo check box and make sure all of the boxes in that subsection are selected.

Link RStudio to GitHub:
