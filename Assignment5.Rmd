#### Problem 1:

Create a list with the following named elements:

  - my_matrix, which is a 4 x 4 matrix filled with random uniform values
  - my_logical, which is a 100-element vector of TRUE or FALSE values. You can do this efficiently by setting up a vector of random values and then applying an inequality to it.
  - my_letters, which is a 26-element vector of all the lower-case letters in random order.

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(runif(16),ncol=4,nrow=4)
rand_dist <- runif(100)
my_logical <- rand_dist>0.5
my_letters <- letters

my_list <- list(my_matrix, my_logical, my_letters) 
```
