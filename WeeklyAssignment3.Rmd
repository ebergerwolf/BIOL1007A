### Recreating a figure

Go to Dryad to choose a published paper and data set and reconstruct your own figure. Code a ggplot graph that looks as close to the published figure as you can.

Original Figure:
![](/Users/ev/Desktop/Middlebury/Classes/Senior/ReproducibleBio/Images/beeDataFigure.jpeg){width=25%}
My attempt:

```{r}
# load in libraries
library(tidyverse) #includes dplyr & ggplot
library(ggthemes)
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)
```

```{r}
# load in data
learning_phase <- read.table(file="Data/Learning_phase.csv", header=T, sep=",")
testing_phase <- read.table(file="Data/Testing_phase.csv", header=T, sep=",")

#reshaping data

```

```{r}
# making the first plot
```
