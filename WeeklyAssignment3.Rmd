### Recreating a figure

Go to Dryad to choose a published paper and data set and reconstruct your own figure. Code a ggplot graph that looks as close to the published figure as you can.

Original Figure:
![](/Users/ev/Desktop/Middlebury/Classes/Senior/ReproducibleBio/Images/beeDataFigure.jpeg){width=25%}
My attempt:

```{r}
# load in libraries
library(tidyverse) #includes dplyr & ggplot
library(ggthemes)
library(patchwork)
library(viridis)
```

```{r}
# load in data
learning_phase <- read.table(file="Data/Learning_phase.csv", header=T, sep=",")
testing_phase <- read.table(file="Data/Testing_phase.csv", header=T, sep=",")

#reshaping data
learning_prop <- tibble(Trial=seq(10,100,10), propCorrect=rep(NA,10))
for(trial in seq(10,100,10)){
  learning_prop$propCorrect[trial/10] <- mean(learning_phase[learning_phase$Trial %in%
                                                               c((trial-9):trial),"Choice"])
}
# learning_prop$Trial <- factor(learning_prop$Trial, levels = seq(10,100,10))
```

```{r}
# making the first plot
learn_plot <- ggplot(learning_prop, aes(x=Trial, y=propCorrect)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_base() +
  xlab("Trials") +
  ylab("Proportion of correct choices") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=c((3:9)/10), limits = c(0.3,0.9)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(10,100,10)) 
  
learn_plot


```
